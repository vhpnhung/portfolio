# Overview

Airbnb was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5 million hosts who have welcomed over 1.5 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.

This analysis aims to provide a vision where data and information empower communities to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists in Barcelona.
